# Ideas

## Mad Libs

Implement the famous game of [Mad Libs].

Ask the user for various words, such as:

  - A noun
  - A verb
  - An adjective
  - A place

Then, display a story with their words subsituted into the appropriate
places. For example:

```
Please enter a noun: bicycle
Please enter a verb: dance
Please enter an adjective: green
Please enter another adjective: curvy
...

Your story:

It was a [green], cold November day. I woke up to the [curvy] smell of a
[bicycle] roasting in the oven. Then, I saw my brother [dance] down the
stairs...
```

### Concepts

  - User (keyboard) input
  - Text output
  - String concatenation
  
### Bonus Ideas

  - Respond with a message if the user doesn't type in a word and make them try
    again.
  - Randomly choose from several stories when the program starts so it's not the
    same every time.


## Pick a Number


### Description

The program should pick a random number between 1 and 100. It should then ask
the user to guess a number. It tells the user whether the number is too high,
too low, or correct. This repeats until the user guesses the right number.

### Concepts

  - If statements
  - While loops
  - User (keyboard) input
  - Parsing (string -> number)
  
### Bonus Ideas

  - Add a number of lives and display a game over message if the user runs out
    of lives.
  - Give a message if the user types in something other than a valid number.
